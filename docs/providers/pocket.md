# Provider: PocketTTS

Model-level information for the `pocket` provider — the things that are true for the whole model,
so they're documented here once instead of repeated on every voice in `/voices`. `quality` is
merged into each voice on `/voices` (a voice may override it in `voices.json`); `controls` is
service-wide only, on `GET /service`, not repeated per voice.

Source: [kyutai/pocket-tts](https://github.com/kyutai-labs/pocket-tts) — a CPU TTS (flow-based LM +
Mimi neural codec).

## Identity

- **Provider id:** `pocket`
- **Voice identifier:** `urn:readium:tts:pocket:<originalName>` (e.g. `urn:readium:tts:pocket:estelle`).
  Requests combine the `identifier` with a `language` — voices are declared **once**, not per
  language. The server picks the right language model behind the scenes.

## Model-level defaults

| Property | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `quality` | `veryHigh` | Quality of the **voice**, not the audio output. All pocket voices are `veryHigh`. Merged into every voice on `/voices`; a voice may override it in `voices.json`. |
| `controls.pitch` | `false` | Not supported. Service-wide only — see `GET /service`. |
| `controls.speed` | `false` | Not supported (no native speed control). Service-wide only. |
| `controls.ssml` | `false` | SSML not supported; tags are stripped, not rendered. Service-wide only. |
| `controls.boundary` | `false` | No word-level timing marks. Service-wide only. |

## Audio output

PocketTTS renders **24 kHz · mono · 16-bit PCM**, returned as a standard **WAV** file with no
re-encoding (the default, and fastest — no ffmpeg). The server can transcode on request:

- `wav` — native, lossless. **Default.**
- `opus` — compressed, high quality. Strong second choice.
- `mp3` — lossy; noticeably worse, not a good default.

`output.sample_rate` is accepted but not applied — output is always the model's native 24 kHz.

## Languages & voices

- **Native languages:** `en` `fr` `it` `de` `es` `pt`. English ships many voices; each other
  language ships one native voice.
- **Cross-language:** any voice can also speak the languages it declares in `otherLanguages`,
  *if* that `(voice, language)` pair is installed (`VOICE_LANGUAGES`). A voice needs the target
  language's base model **and** its per-language speaker embedding — see
  [configuration → model sizes](../configuration.md#model-sizes--ram).
- What's **actually installed** on a deployment is what `GET /voices` returns (realtime). The full
  declared list of possibilities lives in `app/data/voices/pocket/voices.json`.

## Constraints

- CPU only; torch ≥ 2.5 CPU build. Throughput scales by worker processes.
- **Model variant:** most languages ship both a fast/small **6-layer** model and a slower/bigger
  higher-quality **24-layer** (`_24l`) one. We default to **6-layer** everywhere it exists.
  French is the exception — pocket-tts ships only a 24-layer French, so `fr` is always 24-layer.

  | Lang | 6-layer | 24-layer | Used |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | `en` | `english` | — | 6-layer |
  | `fr` | — | `french_24l` | **24-layer (only option)** |
  | `it` | `italian` | `italian_24l` | 6-layer |
  | `de` | `german` | `german_24l` | 6-layer |
  | `es` | `spanish` | `spanish_24l` | 6-layer |
  | `pt` | `portuguese` | `portuguese_24l` | 6-layer |

  (This is why you see `french_24l` but plain `spanish`/`german` — not an inconsistency; French
  has no 6-layer.) The mapping lives in `_LANG_MODEL` (`app/providers/pocket_tts.py`). Making the
  6l/24l choice user-selectable per language is **deferred** pending need — see the follow-up
  issue.
- Each model uses ~2 CPU cores via an internal generate→decode pipeline and pins torch to a
  single intra-op thread itself (on import) — so we don't set `torch.set_num_threads()`. Give
  the box more cores by running more workers, not more threads per model.
